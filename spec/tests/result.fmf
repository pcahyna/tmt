summary: Specify how test result should be interpreted

story:
    As a tester I want to regularly execute the test but
    temporarily ignore test result until more investigation is
    done and the test can be fixed properly.

description: |
    Even if a test fails it might makes sense to execute it to be
    able to manually review the results (ignore test result) or
    ensure the behaviour has not unexpectedly changed and the test
    is still failing (expected fail). The following values are
    supported:

    respect
        test result is respected (fails when test failed)
    xfail
        expected fail (pass when test fails, fail when test passes)
    pass, info, warn, error, fail
        ignore the actual test result and always report provided
        value instead

    The default value is ``respect``.

example: |
    result: xfail
